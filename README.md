## ðŸš€ Running the Application

### Prerequisites for Database Features:
```bash
# Download SQLite JDBC driver
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.44.1.0/sqlite-jdbc-3.44.1.0.jar
```

### Console Version:
```bash
javac -d out src/*.java
java -cp out Main
```

### With Database Support:
```bash
javac -cp sqlite-jdbc-3.44.1.0.jar -d out src/*.java
java -cp "out:sqlite-jdbc-3.44.1.0.jar" Main
```

### GUI Version:
```bash
javac -d out src/*.java
java -cp out LibraryManagementGUI
```
